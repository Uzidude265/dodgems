Dodge the never-ending balls for as long as you can!
The score goes up by 4 every second.
Each ball's colour corresponds to its speed:
Black = Slow, Blue = Medium, Purple = Fast, Red = Very Fast
You have 3 lives until it's game over!
Each time you are hit, you gain invulnerability for 5 seconds.
Colliding into the wall is an instakill!

There are numerous abilities to help you:
Green Arrow: +40 Score (this ability spawns every 4 seconds after collecting)
Ghost: Gain invulnerability from balls for 5 seconds (but not the wall!)
Stopwatch: Slows all of the balls by half their speed for 5 seconds
Error Symbol: Deletes 3 balls randomly
All abilities (with the exception of Plus) spawn every 12 seconds at random.
Note: the same ability cannot spawn in twice in a row.

1. Collect as many Pluses as you can.
You could survive the same amount of time but have more points.
2. You don't have to collect abilities immediately.
You could leave the ability on-screen for later.
(If the ability is chosen at random and is still on the screen, it will move)
3. Avoid the edges of the screen.
The balls only ever spawn in from the sides, so watch out!
